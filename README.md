# Project-06

# Features added
I originally added a player and animations of mixamo but I couldn't get it to work. I wasn't really able to get it working for the other assignment either so I wasn't fully expecting it to work anyway. I decided to create this robot game. I created the movement and camera foollows the player. The dialog appears on the screen of your robot which I really like. I tried to use a navmesh for tghe enemies but i couldn't get it to work so I used a simple solution to get the enemies to move around the map in a square pattern. The enemies can shoot at the player which cause you to lose. The player can shoot the enemies which causes it to blow up. The player must collect parts and bring them back to the blue robot. Once you have all the parts and talk to him, there is a new dialog where he thanks you for fixing him, and all the missing parts are restored on his body. Also I added a cool start screen that includes the character models.
